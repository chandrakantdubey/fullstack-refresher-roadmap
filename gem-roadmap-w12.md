Welcome to the final week. This is the culmination of everything you've learned. You will combine your skills in frontend, backend, databases, and deployment to build a project that's not just functional, but ready for business. You'll integrate two of the most powerful APIs in modern tech: Stripe for payments and OpenAI for artificial intelligence.

Here is the detailed, day-by-day plan for your final week, **Week 12**.

## Week 12: Monetization, AI, & Final Polish

**Project of the Week:** A "SaaS Boilerplate." This is your capstone projectâ€”a complete, multi-tenant application foundation that you can use for any future business idea. It will feature user accounts, organizations, Stripe-powered subscription plans, and an AI-powered content generation feature.

**Key Concepts:** SaaS Architecture, Multi-tenancy, Payment Integration, API Integration, DSA Review.

### **Day 1: SaaS Architecture & Multi-Tenancy**

* **Today's Goal:** Design the data model for a scalable Software as a Service (SaaS) application.
* **Topics:**
    * **What is SaaS?** A software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted.
    * **Multi-tenancy:** The most important concept in SaaS architecture. A single instance of the software serves multiple customers (tenants). We need to ensure that one customer's data is completely isolated from another's.
    * **Data Modeling for SaaS:** Designing a schema that supports users belonging to organizations (or teams), with subscriptions tied to the organization.
* **Tasks:**
    1.  **Project Setup:** Initialize a new Next.js project. We'll use Next.js for its integrated full-stack capabilities. Set up Prisma and connect it to a PostgreSQL database.
    2.  **Design the Prisma Schema:** This is the most critical task today. Create the following models and their relations:
        * `User`: Has a relation to an `Organization`.
        * `Organization`: Can have many `Users`. Will store subscription details like `stripeCustomerId`.
        * `Subscription`: Belongs to an `Organization`. Will store the `plan` (e.g., FREE, PRO), `status` (e.g., active, canceled), and `currentPeriodEnd` date.
    3.  **Implement Basic Auth:** Set up the user authentication system from Week 6 (registration, login) within your Next.js app.

### **Day 2: Setting Up Stripe for Subscriptions**

* **Today's Goal:** Integrate the Stripe API to create subscription checkout sessions.
* **Topics:**
    * **Stripe Checkout:** A prebuilt, hosted payment page that simplifies collecting payments.
    * **Stripe Products & Prices:** How to model your subscription plans (e.g., "Pro Plan" for $20/month) in the Stripe Dashboard.
    * **Creating a Checkout Session:** Using the Stripe Node.js library on your backend to initiate a payment flow for a user.
* **Tasks:**
    1.  **Create a Stripe Account:** Sign up for Stripe and get your test API keys (publishable and secret). Store them in your `.env.local` file.
    2.  **Model Your Plans:** In the Stripe Dashboard, create two products: a "Free Plan" and a "Pro Plan" with a recurring monthly price.
    3.  **Install Stripe Libraries:** Run `npm install stripe @stripe/stripe-js`.
    4.  **Build the API Route:** Create a Next.js API route (`pages/api/stripe/checkout-session.js`). This endpoint will:
        * Authenticate the user.
        * Create a Stripe Checkout Session using `stripe.checkout.sessions.create()`.
        * Return the `sessionId` to the frontend.

### **Day 3: Handling Payments & Webhooks**

* **Today's Goal:** Complete the payment flow by handling the frontend redirect and listening for successful payments with webhooks.
* **Topics:**
    * **Stripe.js:** The client-side Stripe library used to securely redirect users to the Checkout page.
    * **Webhooks:** The mechanism Stripe uses to notify your application about events that happen in your Stripe account, like a successful payment (`checkout.session.completed`). This is essential for fulfillment.
* **Tasks:**
    1.  **Create Pricing Page:** Build a simple pricing page in your React frontend that displays your plans.
    2.  **Implement Frontend Logic:** When a user clicks "Upgrade," call your API route from yesterday to get a `sessionId`. Then use the `redirectToCheckout` function from Stripe.js to send the user to Stripe's payment page.
    3.  **Build Webhook Handler:** Create a new API route (`pages/api/stripe/webhook.js`). This public endpoint will listen for events from Stripe.
    4.  **Fulfill the Order:** In the webhook handler, specifically listen for the `checkout.session.completed` event. When you receive it, extract the customer and subscription details, and **update your own database**. Set the user's `Organization` `Subscription` status to "active" and save the relevant IDs.

### **Day 4: Integrating Artificial Intelligence**

* **Today's Goal:** Add a high-value feature to your SaaS by integrating the OpenAI API.
* **Topics:**
    * **Large Language Models (LLMs):** A brief overview of what powers services like ChatGPT.
    * **OpenAI API:** The platform that gives you programmatic access to powerful AI models.
    * **API Completions Endpoint:** The primary endpoint for sending a prompt and receiving a generated text response.
* **Tasks:**
    1.  **Get an API Key:** Sign up for the OpenAI platform and get an API key. Add it to your `.env.local` file.
    2.  **Install OpenAI Library:** Run `npm install openai`.
    3.  **Create an AI Service:** In your backend, create a simple function that takes a prompt as input.
    4.  **Build AI API Route:** Create a new API route (`pages/api/generate.js`). This protected route will:
        * Authenticate the user.
        * Take a prompt from the request body.
        * Call the OpenAI API with the prompt.
        * Return the AI-generated text to the frontend.

### **Day 5: Tying AI to Subscriptions**

* **Today's Goal:** Connect your new AI feature to your subscription plans to create a real business model.
* **Topics:**
    * **Usage-Based Entitlements:** Limiting access to features based on a user's subscription tier.
    * **Rate Limiting:** Protecting your API from abuse and managing costs.
* **Tasks:**
    1.  **Build the Frontend:** Create a new page in your app for the "Content Generator." It should have a form where the user can enter a prompt.
    2.  **Implement Usage Logic:** In your `/api/generate` endpoint, before calling the OpenAI API, add a crucial check:
        * Look up the user's `Organization` and their current `Subscription` plan from your database.
        * If they are on the "Free Plan," you might check if they've exceeded a monthly quota (e.g., 5 generations). If so, return an error telling them to upgrade.
        * If they are on the "Pro Plan," allow the request to proceed.
    3.  **Track Usage:** After a successful generation for a free user, you can increment a `usage` count in your database.
* **Learning Resources:**
    * Review your Prisma schema and data access patterns from Week 4.

### **Day 6: Final Polish & DSA Review**

* **Today's Goal:** Clean up the application and refresh your foundational computer science knowledge.
* **Tasks:**
    1.  **Build a User Dashboard:** Create a central dashboard page where a logged-in user can see their current subscription status.
    2.  **Add Stripe Customer Portal:** Add a "Manage Billing" button that links to the Stripe Customer Portal, allowing users to update their credit card or cancel their plan without you writing any code.
    3.  **Code Cleanup:** Refactor your entire application. Ensure all secrets are loaded from environment variables. Add comments and clean up your UI.
    4.  **DSA Review Session:** Dedicate 2-3 hours to pure, focused DSA review. Go over the time and space complexity (**Big O notation**) of common operations for:
        * Arrays
        * Hash Maps (Objects/Maps in JS)
        * Linked Lists
        * Trees
