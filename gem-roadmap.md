12-Week Intensive Full-Stack Developer Roadmap
This roadmap is designed to be project-driven, taking you from fundamental concepts to building and deploying four basic, four medium, and four advanced, industry-grade applications.

Part 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-4)
Focus: Building core skills in frontend, backend, and databases. You'll build 4 basic but deployable projects.

Week 1: Frontend Fundamentals & Modern CSS

Topics: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), Git/GitHub, Tailwind CSS, Responsive Design.

Concepts: DRY Principle.

Tools: VS Code, Git, GitHub.

Project 1 (Basic): A fully responsive, multi-page portfolio website built with Tailwind CSS.

Week 2: React & Modern Frontend Tooling

Topics: React (Functional Components, Hooks), Vite, JSX, State & Props, Component Lifecycle.

Tools: Vite, npm/yarn.

Project 2 (Basic): An interactive front-end for a "Movie Finder" app that fetches data from a public API.

Week 3: Backend Development with Node.js & Express

Topics: Node.js, Express.js, RESTful API principles, Middleware, Environment Variables.

Concepts: Handling Requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Tools: Postman (for API testing).

Project 3 (Basic): A REST API for a simple blogging platform.

Week 4: Databases with PostgreSQL & ORMs

Topics: PostgreSQL, Relational Database Design, SQL basics, ORM (Prisma), Data Modeling.

Concepts: ACID properties, Normalization.

Project 4 (Basic): A full-stack "To-Do List" application, connecting your React frontend to a PostgreSQL database via your Express API.

Part 2: Full-Stack Integration & Intermediate Skills (Weeks 5-8)
Focus: Connecting the stack, implementing authentication, and building more complex applications. You'll build 4 medium-tier projects that could support a small subscription.

Week 5: Connecting Frontend & Backend

Topics: React Router, Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, async/await), Fetching data in React, CORS.

Project 5 (Medium): A "Recipe Book" application where users can browse, add, and save recipes (full-stack).

Week 6: Advanced Authentication & Security

Topics: Advanced Authentication flows, JSON Web Tokens (JWT), Password Hashing, Protected Routes (Frontend & Backend).

Project 6 (Medium): A user authentication system for a "Social Media Dashboard" where users can sign up, log in, and view a protected profile page.

Week 7: Advanced State Management & Data Fetching

Topics: React Query (TanStack) for server state management, Global state management (Zustand or Redux Toolkit).

Concepts: Client-side vs. Server-side state.

Project 7 (Medium): A "Project Management Tool" (like a Trello clone) with drag-and-drop features, using React Query to manage backend data.

Week 8: WebSockets & Testing

Topics: Sockets (Socket.io) for real-time communication, Intro to Testing.

Testing Libraries: Jest, React Testing Library.

Project 8 (Medium): A real-time "Chat Application" where multiple users can join a room and chat.

Part 3: Advanced Topics & Industry-Grade Projects (Weeks 9-12)
Focus: Deployment, scalability, advanced frameworks, and monetization. You'll build 4 industry-grade projects ready for paying customers.

Week 9: CI/CD, Containers, & Deployment

Topics: Docker, CI/CD Pipeline Setup (GitHub Actions), SSH into a server, Deploying to a cloud service (e.g., DigitalOcean, AWS).

Project 9 (Advanced): Create a full CI/CD pipeline for the Chat Application from Week 8, containerize it with Docker, and deploy it.

Week 10: System Design & Caching

Topics: Introduction to System Design, Scalability concepts (Load Balancing, Database Replication), Caching strategies.

Tools: Redis for caching.

Project 10 (Advanced): Design and build the backend for a "Link Shortener" service, optimized for high performance with a caching layer using Redis.

Week 11: Advanced Frameworks with Next.js

Topics: Next.js, Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site Generation (SSG), File-based routing, API Routes.

Project 11 (Advanced): A full-stack "E-commerce Storefront" built with Next.js for optimal performance and SEO.

Week 12: Monetization, AI, & Final Polish

Topics: Payment Integration (Stripe), AI Integration (using OpenAI API), Final review of DSA concepts.

Project 12 (Advanced): A "SaaS Boilerplate" project. This will be a multi-tenant application with Stripe subscriptions, user organizations, and an AI-powered feature (e.g., a content generator). This project combines everything you've learned and is a perfect starting point for any future SaaS idea.
